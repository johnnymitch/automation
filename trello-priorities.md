# How to prioritise Trello tasks

## 1. Add items to the "To do next (priority)" list
This list is for important tasks that should be done next in the schedule.

## 2. Add tasks to the top of the list
Tasks are prioritised in a top-down manner. That is, the higher up the list the card is, the more priority over other tasks it has.

## 3. Add the "TOP PRIORITY" label to the card
Cards that have the red "TOP PRIORITY" label are tasks that need to be urgently addressed.

# Prioritise via Google Sheet

![](http://jmitch.me/github/clip_1.png)

- Open up the spreadsheet template (as per the screenshot above)
- Copy tasks from Trello (task name)
- Select the text in the Sheet and hold CMD + K (or CTRL + K on Windows), and add a URL to the Trello task
- Add a priority (Urgent, High, Medium, Low)
- Add a status (To do, In progress, Staging, Review, Done)
- Add an estimate (e.g. 1h, 30m)
- Add notes (if applicable)

## Rules

- ONLY add tasks that are **NOT** in the backlog. Tasks in the backlog have not been schedule yet, therefore they are not relevant.
- Ensure all tasks in the sheet have a link back to Trello, otherwise there is not a reference.
- Priority is done in a **top down** manner, as it's impossible to schedule tasks in a numerical fasion, e.g. 1, 2, 3, 50, 51 etc. that gets too hard to manage.
