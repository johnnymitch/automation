# How to prioritise Trello tasks

## 1. Add items to the "To do next (priority)" list
This list is for important tasks that should be done next in the schedule.

## 2. Add tasks to the top of the list
Tasks are prioritised in a top-down manner. That is, the higher up the list the card is, the more priority over other tasks it has.

## 3. Add the "TOP PRIORITY" label to the card
Cards that have the red "TOP PRIORITY" label are tasks that need to be urgently addressed.
