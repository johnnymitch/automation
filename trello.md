# How I use Trello

## Setup
- Weekly board
- Daily list

## Rules
- On each list of my weekly board, cards should not exceed the height of the screen (e.g. no scrolling), so that they're all always in view.
- <15 min tasks should be scheduled to do on-the-asap to prevent lingering and cognative overload that accumulates (as many will be stored in the back of your mind)
